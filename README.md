## Session One

Start off in the world-famous bar and inn, the Yawning Portal. The portal goes to the Undermountain. It costs a gold to go down, and a gold to come back up. **Durnan** is the builder and founder.

Half orc is hit by a human with a shaved head, covered by eye-shaped tattoos. Human has 4 allies. The human with the tattoos is part of the Xanathar guild.

Female half-orc introduces herself as **Yagra Strongfist**. She is  expresses gratitude but also wishes Zarrius didn't interfere. Zarrius mentions it wouldn't have been fair (5 v 1) which she agrees to.

The Yawning Portal makes sounds. Creature climbs out with worry green skin and hair. Bloodshot eyes. Half a dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, and a few flying.

Durnan yells, "Troll!" He then grabs a greatsword from behind the bar and leaps over. Stirges cover the troll's body and fly around.

*[combat happens here]*

Zarrius gets killing blow on the troll with Eldritch Blast, which caused its chest to be caved in.

Mystery man seems to well dressed and intelligence. He invites Ricard and Professor Pinoah. The party is within ear-shot and drinking alcohol to celebrate their victory.

Volothamp Geddarm believes that his dear friend Floon Blagmaar was kidnapped, or worse. Remy wonders if his "deer" friend was a doe. ðŸ™ƒ 

Floon and Volo were at the Skeward Dragon the other night. Volo left before he did, and he hasn't seen Floon since. Floon was in fine clothing, and that's why he believes it may be a kidnapping.

Yagra hints for Zarrius to come over. Mentions she is in the **Zhentarim Guild**, an "organization" in moving weapons and mercenaries.

OOC assumption: The other bandits are likely in the **Xanathar Guild**.

Garkus asks for a description. Flunn is a handsome human male. Early 30s. Wavy red-blonde hair. Dressed in princely-garb.

Heading to the *Dock Ward*. The street sweepers do not go there often. Most the lanterns are broken or have had the candles stolen. We find ourselves in a street that's been quaranteed. Officers are in the area and there are multiple corpses. The City Watch are going around to witnesses and gathering statements. A black-robed Magister (the *Black Robes*) is writing down notes. The party is asked to move along.

Black leather armor == 3 captured people.

Ground level is very shadowed in the dark ward due to the tall structures. There's a strange shop that stands out from the others. Has a deep purpose fascade, and a stuffed beholder is in the window. The door says the **Old Xablob Shop**. 

Finally make it to the Skewed Dragon. It looks like it's in shambles. The windows are broken and it's a bad scene, but there are patreons drinking. At this time of night, there's a fine mist that fills the street. There's a handful of dock workers drinking. Zarrius opens the door for the party, and keeps it held open for them with his tiefling tail.

Bartender is a thin, boney man who has been seemingly ignoring the party. Garkus asks if he has seen somebody with Floon's description. He doesn't budge. The bartender pours drinks, but then places them on the other side of the bar. 

Ricar asks the bartender once the rest of the party is on the other side of the bar where Floon may be. Bartender says the young fancy lad was here with Geddarm, whom left early. Floon took up a conversation with a shady person, and left with 4 men dressed in black leather. These individuals frequent a warehouse with a snake on the doorhandle.

The party arrives at the warehouse. There's a wooden door that's closed, but also a swinging gate that's closed. There's a back door that may be openable. Ricar triesd to unlock, but it doesn't give. Garkus bursts through the door with his strength. The inside is dimly light and there are boxes scattered around everywhere. There is a walkway on the second floor. Four short avian creatures look at the party in surprise, from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse. Each has a dark cloak and is wielding a sword.

Birds are weird.

"Yellow lines will take us to the sewers."
"I think he was taken by the Zhentarim."
Orc took him.

On forearms or necks, a tattoo of a winged snake. 

Winged Serpent = Zhentarim.
Black Leather = Xanathar. Tattoo of an eye on their palms. With 10 lines sticking out from it.

Kenku has a bleeding arm and runs down. 

Individuals in black leather that are dead. There are seven other thugs that are dead. THere are a set of stairs that go up to the second level. THere boxes.

**Renaer Neverember** is the son of the former Open Lord. Floon and Renaer were captured, but Floon was taken and then Renaer hid. They were trying to get Renaer though given his status. Renaer has not seen his father since he went to Neverwinter. 

The Zhentarim think that Renaer's father embezzeled a large amount of money while he was open lord of Waterdeep. And that he hid millions of dragons in the city. They think they can find it by using an artifact *the Stone of Galore*, which was in the hands of the *Xanathar Guild*. Someone apparently stole it. The Xanathar have their roots below the city in the sewers.

Just then, a loud pounding noise emits from the City Watch.
